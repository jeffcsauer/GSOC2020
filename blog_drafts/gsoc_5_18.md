# Welcome to my first 'official' GSOC blog post!

Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020 has been going for a couple weeks now and I thought it would be fun to share what progress has been made so far. If you're just joining now you should know that the first month or so is the 'Community Bonding Period'. During this time the student developers get to know their community, establish expectations, and set recurring check-in meetings. 

# Initial community bonding

Pitching in on the gitter channel (cpu core post, large spatial databases for testing)

The first GSOC call was 5/15/2020. It was a pleasure to chat with the other PySAL GSOC students [Mragank Shekhar](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=pysal#5775104799145984) and [Pablo Estrada](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=pysal#6472262816890880). Mragank will be focusing on raster integration with PySAL, and Pablo will be developing panel spatial econometric models. Both of these projects will offer some tremendous developments to PySAL and I look forward to getting to know them more over the summer. 

An ESDA enhancements call will be held on 5/22/2020. This will be a mix of getting to know the project mentors and talking generally about the project. I've already gotten a bit of a head start (see below!) as 

# What have I been up to in addition to community bonding?

created a github workspace that will track my progression over the summer
- worked through the pysal implementation of local join counts and moran's i, reworking them for local join counts and losh
- working through local join counts (univariate and losh), going to adapt into a function in coming weeks

ensuring my workspace was setup to load pysal and dependencies, forking projects, etc...

# What do I want to get out of GSOC?

After already spending a week or so of digging into exploratory spatial data analysis, I think there is some intrinsic value to this notion of spatial autocorrelation . It has made me think of so many other metrics that might be useful (but might not have the catchiest name), like a 'cluster disruption test' that would assess the influence of removing a unit on local/global spatial autocorrelation. 

Beyond inspiring my own work on spatial analysis, I am greatly enjoying the developing my own coding skills while contributing 

looking back as an eager undergrad and so intimidated by tools like Github. Now I love them!
