# More community bonding!

GSOC-wide call, what did we talk about

# What have I been up to in addition to community bonding?

The past couple of weeks I have been working on pseudo-coding the implementation of LOSH, uni/bi/multi-variate LJC. I've now migrated all of them into functions with the structure of scikit-learn.

# The importance of inference

working through Bivand and Wong 2018, 'Comparing implementations of global and local indicators of spatial association'. a beast of a paper! this could be a pathway into the p-value crisis for geography. needs to be a greater understanding about p-value sensitivity and develop more rigorous frameworks with perhaps strange quesitons. for example, how do different lattice structures impact p-value calculations? 

**More advances in my understanding of development**
