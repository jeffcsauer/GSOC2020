    "In the following notebook we review the local spatial heteroskedasticity (LOSH) statistic ($H_i$) put forward by [Ord and Getis (2012)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-011-0492-y). LOSH is meant as an accompainment to the local statistics that analyze the mean level of a spatial process. LOSH focuses on analyzing the variance of the spatial process.\n",

    "As outlined by Ord and Getis, consider a 10 x 10 grid of property values. Within this grid, there is a central high-rent district (identified by cells that are 1) and a surrounding lower-value area (identified by cells that are 0. We can visualize this spatial arrangement as:\n",

    "While we can see that the inner core of the high-rent district have similar values to their neigbhors (i.e. a cells of 1 surrounded by other cells of 1), this is less true when we consider the outer rim of the high-rent district. This rim represents a possible transition region between the stable inner high-rent area and the stable outer lower value areas. Ord and Getis seek to use the LOSH statistic ($H_i$) to identify this transitional region between the two areas."
