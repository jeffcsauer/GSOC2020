# Welcome to my GSOC2020 workbook!

This is a work diary of all my progress in GSOC2020. 

If you are interested in reading my blog posts about the experience, head over [to my website](https://jeffcsauer.github.io/post/) and check out any posts with the GSOC tag. 

This will mostly be for coding attempts, building out testing, and writing notebooks. 

The repository is organized as follows:
