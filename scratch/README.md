These workbooks are a 'scratch' workspace where I can pseudo code (and roughly code!) each of the estimators. Each notebook is as follows:

- LOSH_workbook.ipynb : working through LOSH calculations
- OLJC_workbook_bi_multi_variate.ipynb : working through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate local join count calculations
- migration.ipynb : migrating each of the rough codes into scikit-learn based functions
