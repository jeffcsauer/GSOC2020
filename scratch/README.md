These workbooks are a 'scratch' workspace where I can pseudo code (and roughly code!) each of the estimators. Each notebook is as follows:

- GSoC_Phase1_Demonstration.ipynb: collecting all of my progress for Phase 1 of GSoC. Will share with both mentors and wider `PySAL` community.
- Issues_Scratch.ipynb: a place where I can work through the issues [raised on the workbook Github page](https://github.com/jeffcsauer/GSOC2020/issues)
- LOSH_workbook.ipynb : working through LOSH calculations
- OLJC_workbook_bi_multi_variate.ipynb : working through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate local join count calculations
- migration.ipynb : migrating each of the rough codes into scikit-learn based functions
