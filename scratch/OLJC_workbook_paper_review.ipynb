In other words, it focuses on how many of the neighbors have a value xj = 1 , but ignores where these nonzero values occur among the neighbor sites (what Boots 2006, refers to as the configuration). In Boots (2006), several approaches are proposed to analyze patterns on regular lattice structures. However, the proposed methods do not generalize to irregular spatial layouts.\n",

    "\n",
    "    A conditional permutation test as proposed in Anselin (1995) to compute a pseudo p value for the LISA statistics can be constructed in the usual way. The general principle, for those locations i where xi = 1 , is to carry out a series of random permutations of the remaining observations, while counting the times the number of neighbors with xj = 1 equals or exceeds qi , the observed value of the join counts. In practice, this is implemented by taking ki (the number of neighbors for i) draws without replacement from a set of N − 1 observations with K − 1 values of 1 for those observations where xi = 1 . A pseudo p value can be computed as (v + 1)∕(r + 1) , where v is the number of times the neighbors have qi or more values equal 1, and r is the number of permutations. The standard caveats apply (e.g., sensitivity to the number of permutations, varying results depending on the random number sequence, multiple comparisons, etc.). It should be noted that, as a one-sided test, the conditional permutation approach includes instances as rejecting the null of spatial randomness where there are more than qi neighbors with xj = 1 in the computation of the pseudo p value.\n",

    "1. Without in-situ co-location (i.e. co-location in i, but not in neighbors). This is a situation where $x_i$ and $z_i$ do NOT take on the same value at $i$ or $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be the example where $x_i=1$ for location $i$ and the other variable $z_i=0$. This may be useful when x and z correspond 'to two different values of a single categorical variable [that has been split across many columns]'.\n",

    "\n",
    "To reiterate, the above situation only works when $z_i=0$ and $x_i = 1$. While x and z can be reversed, the statistic is not symmetric, so the results may be different whether x or z is the focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another special part of this is when $x_i \\neq z_i \\forall i$, the statistic can be simplified to:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is implemented by carrying out a series of ki draws for each location i where xi = 1 and zi = 0 . The draws are without replacement from N − 1 data tuples (xj, zj) of which Q observations have z = 1 (since zi = 0 ) and P − 1 observations have x = 1 .11 In practice, we only need to draw the zj , since the matching xj are zero by construction. The number of times the resulting local join count statistic from Eq. 3 equals or exceeds the observed value yields a pseudo p value.\n",

We draw ki pairs of observations (xj, zj) from the set of N − 1 (this contains P − 1 observations with xj = 1 and Q − 1 observations with zj = 1 ). In a onesided test, we again count the number of times the statistic in Eq. 4 equals or exceeds the observed join count value at i."
